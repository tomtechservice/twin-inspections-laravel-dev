IT EXPLAINS THE SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF A STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL INSPECTION AND A WOOD DESTROYING PEST &amp; ORGANISM INSPECTION REPORT.</strong><br /><br /><br />A WOOD DESTROYING PEST &amp; ORGANISM INSPECTION REPORT CONTAINS FINDINGS AS TO THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OF WOOD DESTROYING ORGANISMS IN VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE AREAS AND CONTAINS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CORRECTING ANY INFESTATIONS OR INFECTIONS FOUND. THE CONTENTS OF WOOD DESTROYING PEST &amp; ORGANISM INSPECTION REPORTS ARE GOVERNED BY THE STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL ACT AND REGULATIONS. <br /><br />SOME STRUCTURES DO NOT COMPLY WITH BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS OR MAY HAVE STRUCTURAL, PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, MECHANICAL, HEATING, AIR CONDITIONING OR OTHER DEFECTS THAT DO NOT PERTAIN TO WOOD DESTROYING ORGANISMS. A WOOD DESTROYING PEST &amp; ORGANISM INSPECTION REPORT DOES NOT CONTAIN INFORMATION ON SUCH DEFECTS, IF ANY, AS THEY ARE NOT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE LICENSES OF EITHER THIS COMPANY, OR ITS EMPLOYEES. <br /><br />THE STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL ACT REQUIRES INSPECTION OF ONLY THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION. SOME AREAS OF THE STRUCTURE ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO INSPECTION, SUCH AS INACCESSIBLE AND/OR INSULATED ATTICS OR PORTIONS THEREOF, ATTICS WITH LESS THAN 18 INCHES CLEAR CRAWL SPACE, THE INTERIOR OF HOLLOW WALLS, SPACES BETWEEN FLOORS, AREAS CONCEALED BY CARPETING, APPLIANCES, FURNITURE OR CABINETS. INFESTATIONS OR INFECTIONS MAY BEACTIVE IN THESE AREAS WITHOUT VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE EVIDENCE. IF YOU DESIRE INFORMATION ABOUT AREAS THAT WERE NOT INSPECTED A FURTHER INSPECTION MAY BE PERFORMED AT AN ADDITIONAL COST. CARPETS, FURNITURE OR APPLIANCES ARE NOT MOVED AND WINDOWS ARE NOT OPENED DURING A ROUTINE INSPECTION. THIS IS AN INSPECTION FROM THE GROUND LEVEL. AREAS ABOVE 10 FEET WERE VISUALLY INSPECTED ONLY. TWIN HOME SERVICES ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CONDITIONS THAT WERE NOT EVIDENT FROM GROUND LEVEL. <br /><br /><strong>THE EXTERIOR SURFACE OF THE ROOF WAS NOT INSPECTED. IF YOU WANT THE WATER TIGHTNESS OF THE ROOF DETERMINED, YOU SHOULD CONTACT A ROOFING CONTRACTOR WHO IS LICENSED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. AN INSPECTION IS PERFORMED FROM THE GROUND LEVEL ONLY TO VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE AREAS.</strong> <br /><br />THIS COMPANY DOES NOT CERTIFY OR GUARANTEE AGAINST ANY LEAKAGE, SUCH AS (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) PLUMBING, APPLIANCES, WALLS, DOORS, WINDOWS, ANY TYPE OF SEEPAGE, ROOF OR DECK COVERINGS. THIS COMPANY RENDERS NO GUARANTEE, WHATSOEVER, AGAINST ANY INFECTION, INFESTATION OR ANY OTHER ADVERSE CONDITION WHICH MAY EXIST IN SUCH AREAS OR MAY BECOME VISIBLY EVIDENT IN SUCH AREA AFTER THIS DATE. THIS COMPANY DOES NOT WATER TEST UPPER LEVEL SHOWER PANS DUE TO DAMAGE THAT MAY OCCUR FROM SUCH LEAKAGE TO THE CEILING BELOW. UPON REQUEST, FURTHER INSPECTION OF THESE AREAS WOULD BE PERFORMED AT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE. <br /><br />IN THE EVENT DAMAGE OR INFESTATION DESCRIBED HEREIN IS LATER FOUND TO EXTEND FURTHER THAN ANTICIPATED, ALL WORK WILL CEASE AND A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE ISSUED. OWNER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS CLOSED BID WHEN CONTRACTING WITH OTHERS OR UNDERTAKING THE WORK HIMSELF/HERSELF. <br /><br />ALL PESTICIDES AND FUNGICIDES MUST BE APPLIED BY A STATE CERTIFIED APPLICATOR (SEC.8555 BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE DIVISION 3) AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURERS LABEL REQUIREMENTS. <br /><br /><strong>"*NOTICE: REPORTS ON THIS STRUCTURE PREPARED BY VARIOUS REGISTERED COMPANIES SHOULD LIST THE SAME FINDINGS (I.E. TERMITE INFESTATIONS, TERMITE DAMAGE, FUNGUS DAMAGE, ETC.). HOWEVER, RECOMMENDATIONS TO CORRECT THESE FINDINGS MAY VARY FROM COMPANY TO COMPANY. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO SEEK A SECOND OPINION FROM ANOTHER COMPANY." <br /><br />THE WOOD DESTROYING PEST &amp; ORGANISMS REPORT DOES NOT INCLUDE MOLD OR ANY MOLD LIKE CONDITIONS. NO REFERENCE WILL BE MADE TO MOLD OR MOLD-LIKE CONDITIONS. MOLD IS NOT A WOOD DESTROYING ORGANISM AND IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS REPORT AS DEFINED BY THE STRUCTURAL PEST CONTROL ACT. IF YOU WISH YOUR PROPERTY TO BE INSPECTED FOR MOLD OR MOLD LIKE CONDITIONS, PLEASE CONTACT A CERTIFIED INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST.</strong> <br /><br />THERE MAY BE HEALTH RELATED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINDINGS REFLECTED IN THIS REPORT. WE ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO AND DO NOT RENDER AN OPINION CONCERNING ANY SUCH HEALTH ISSUES. THE INSPECTION REFLECTED BY THIS REPORT WAS LIMITED TO THE VISIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE AREAS ONLY.
